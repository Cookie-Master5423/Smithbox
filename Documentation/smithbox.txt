# MAP EDITOR
- Add meta-data file to hold MapTransformNode changes for a project, so transform adjustments (as they are used to move the map in the editor) can be kept.

# PARAM
- Calculation window:
 - Automatically display gameplay balance data such for currently selected row
  - For example: Physical/Magic/Fire/Lightning damage with configurable stat input, accounting for CalcCorrectGraph

- Correct row index support in the Param Editor in places where it doesn't function correctly (e.g. row name import)

- These official defs don't match the actual param layout, need to adjust them:
 - ThrustersLocomotionParam_PC
 - ThrustersParam_NPC
 - ThrustersParam_PC
 
- Update AC6 paramdex to use released AC6 paramdefs + adjust other stuff based on discoveries
