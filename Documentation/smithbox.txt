# TO ADD
#--------------------------------------
# Reminder
Push 'Release' builds to github releases, not the 'Debug' builds
Update imgui.default

General:
 - ADD: Add format json support for the other MSB types.
 - ADD: Add articles covering all of the features and common use-cases in Smithbox
 
Interface:
 - ADD: Change the toolbar panels into single "Actions" panel with collapsible groups + add drop-down actions to menu-bar
 - ADD: Edit History panel: works like the logger but as a separate window. (Add EditLog prints to all actions)
 
Viewport:
 - ADD: support for transparent shapes, so regions can be better visualized
 - ADD: support for billboard sprites, e.g. images that are rendered towards the camera but placed at a fixed point in the viewport space
 
Map Editor: 
 - ADD: .BTAB support
 - ADD: .GRASS support
 - ADD: .ENTRYFILELIST support
 - ADD: enum support for the DS3 corpse poses
 - ADD: "Data Export" action for MSB data: output the MSB information as JSON
 - ADD: "Find Value Instances" for MSB values
 - ADD: Add collision display for Assets: add secondary mesh alongside main Asset mesh, that holds the collision model.
 - FIX: select via arrow keys in the Map Scene tree (alias seems to stop it working).
 - FIX: DS2 Map Pieces aren't loaded.
 
Model Editor: 
 - ADD: FBX Import into loose FLVER
 - ADD: FBX Export of Loaded Model
 - ADD: skeleton and skinning support for playing animations
 - ADD: easier toggling of model masks based on associated NpcParam (for characters)
 - ADD: floating text for dummy poly ref IDs
 - ADD: floating text for co-ordinate direction (X, Y, Z)
 - ADD: dummy poly forward/upwards representation
 - FIX: viewport meshes should reflect changes to FLVER meshes (currently initial load meshes are always used)
 - ADD: proper handling for the flag fields in the FLVER
 - ADD: GX Item mapping so the byte arrays are more comprehesible
 - FIX: flag fields: they should be a set of checkboxes that resolve into the correct int value
 - ADD: render bone connections (use patrol route method)

Material Editor
 - ADD: Implement Material/MATBIN editor

Param Editor:
 - FIX: move Color Pickers into in-line position with last color field
 - ADD: stayparam support for DS3 (requires 'blob' editor with manual definitions)
 - ADD: Able to sort row order manually
 - ADD: button to restore param to vanilla fields
 - ADD: let Color Picker work for changing color
 - ADD: pin groups (under tools), for quickly switching between defined param/row/field pin groups (remove the project.json aspect if this is added)

Text Editor:
 - FIX: the patch separation of FMGs
 - FIX: vanilla entry should be preferred over dlc01/dlc02 entry
 
Gparam Editor:
 - ADD: json export/import of GPARAM (plus sub-classes?)
 - ADD: gparam reference support (e.g. jump to map param, and if it is offset, that value entry offset)
 - ADD: sticky selection: don't automatically clear selection, rather only clear it if it becomes invalid

Texture Viewer: 
 - ADD: support for 'custom' Shoebox Layouts for non-Shoebox Layout games. Smithbox will instead read from a Shoebox folder in .smithbox for these games.
 - ADD: ability to edit Shoebox Layouts (subwindow)
 - ADD: ability to inject new DDS file into existing binder (would need to move ROOT instances to MOD first)
 - ADD: ability to export selected icon 'section' of icon file (assuming texture has a shoebox layout)
 - FIX: Support AC6 Parts (need to change how ResourceManager holds the virtual paths since the AC6 uses the same filename but with different extensions)
 
Behavior Editor:
 - ADD: behavior HKX editor
 - ADD: character HKX editor
 - ADD: skeleton HKX editor
 - ADD: collision HKX editor
 
World Map:
 - ADD: the dungeon icons, add icon radius for the non-open world maps
 - ADD: support for large/medium/small tile overlays
 
#--------------------------------------
# Notes
#--------------------------------------
- Re-work keybinding menu: make the layout fixed (so entries always appear properly)
 - Allow for Ctrl/Shift/Alt shortcuts (currently they can only be modifiers)

- Make the param massedit auto-builder more obvious:
 - Add the the toolbar version
 - Add submit buttons instead of the weird selectables

- Add EditLogs to all actions
