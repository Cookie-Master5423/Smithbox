# TODO
- Implement VFS / data flow changes to the editors

- Rework the Map List content view stuff: implement MapBank msb file list 
when VFS/File Dictionary is implememented, remove the ContentView aspect entirely.
Legacy issue, but more obvious now you can swap projects quickly
 
- Visibility icon is displayed with a bad visual offset (compared to old version)

- Param Editor: Mass edit isn't working correctly

- Keybinds: Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V don't work correctly for copying InputText content
