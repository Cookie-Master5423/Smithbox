# TODO
- Map Editor: implement orthographic view

- Project: add Param Enum Editor back
- Add Behavior Editor

- Map Editor: re-jig the map load process to use new MapBank approach (e.g. load MSB, build MapContainer from it)
 - This is necessary for release: currently map list isn't properly refreshed on project change
- Model Editor: implement VFS + data bank overhaul
- Texture Viewer: implement VFS + data bank overhaul
- Time Act Editor: implement VFS + data bank overhaul

# FIX
- Map Editor: Visibility icon is displayed with a bad visual offset (compared to old version)
