# TODO
- Rework the Map List content view stuff: implement MapBank msb file list 
when VFS/File Dictionary is implememented, remove the ContentView aspect entirely.
Legacy issue, but more obvious now you can swap projects quickly
 
- Visibility icon is displayed with a bad visual offset (compared to old version)

- Param Editor: fix the Merge Param data target selection -- display list of compatible projects to merge in
- Param Editor: fix the Aux Comparison column selection -- display list of compatible projects to draw from
