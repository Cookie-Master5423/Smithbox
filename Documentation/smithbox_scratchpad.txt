# TODO
- Rework the Map List content view stuff: implement MapBank msb file list 
when VFS/File Dictionary is implememented, remove the ContentView aspect entirely.
Legacy issue, but more obvious now you can swap projects quickly
 
- Visibility icon is displayed with a bad visual offset (compared to old version)

- Need to update Param Upgrader to use new instruction JSON

- Autofill is broken: the Search engines that were static are now constantly being created, 
need to adjust it so they are only created once
